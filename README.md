# Organic Groups (OG)

The Organic Groups module (also referred to as the `og` module), provides users
the ability to create, manage, and delete their own 'groups' on a site.
Each group can have members, and maintains a group home page which individual
group members may post into. Posts can be sent to multiple groups (i.e. cross-
posted), and individual posts (referred as 'group content') may be shared with
members, or non-members where necessary. Group membership can be open, closed
or moderated.
